<p>
one of the oldest recorded ciphers, known as <i>Caesar’s cipher</i>, is described in <i>De Vita Caesarum, Divus Iulius</i> ("The Lives of the Caesars, the Deified Julius"), written in approximately 110 CE:<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
there are also letters of his to Cicero, as well as to his intimates on private affairs, and in the letter, if he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out&#x2026;<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Julius Caesar encrypted by shifting the letters of the alphabet 3 places forward: <b>a</b> was replaced with <b>D</b>, <b>b</b> with <b>E</b>, and so on. at the very end of the alphabet, the letters wrap around and so <b>z</b> was replaced with <b>C</b>, <b>y</b> with <b>B</b>, and <b>x</b> with <b>A</b>. for example, encryption of the message <b>begin the attack now</b>, with spaces removed, gives <b>EHJLQWKHDWWDFNQRZ</b>.<br />
